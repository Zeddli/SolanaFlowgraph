Judging Criteria
Submissions will be evaluated on the following baseline criteria in addition to track-specific elements:

Originality: attribution required if you build off existing work

Accuracy: Factual accuracy of the information and the relevance of the data used.

Resources: Inclusion of resources to support your claims with proper attributions.

Writing Style & Presentation: Quality, readability, and engagement level of your content.

Disqualifications:

Submissions will be rejected if:

They are not in English.

All submissions must attach links to any references used (failure to include may result in rejection).

The link to your submission must be publicly viewable on and after the submission deadline.

In addition, entries will be judged on:

Innovation & Impact: How effectively does the tool visualize complex blockchain data in an intuitive way?

Technical Execution: Robustness of the data integration, performance of the visualization, and quality of the code.

User Experience: Ease-of-use and clarity of visual outputs, enabling both casual users and experts to derive insights.

Investigation Utility: Ability to support deep-dive investigations into protocols, wallets, and transactions.





Task Breakdown and Timeline
Assuming 16 hours of work across 2 days (8 hours per day), here’s the detailed timeline:
Day 1
8:00 AM - 10:00 AM: Set Up Development Environment (2 hours)  
Install tools (e.g., Node.js, a visualization library like D3.js or Cytoscape.js).  

Ensure compatibility with Solana API or prepare a mock dataset.  

Goal: A working foundation to build upon.

10:00 AM - 1:00 PM: Data Fetching and Processing (3 hours)  
Fetch Solana transaction data via API (e.g., Solana JSON RPC) or use a pre-existing dataset.  

Process data into a format suitable for visualization (e.g., nodes: wallets, edges: transactions).  

Ensure accuracy by cross-checking with official Solana documentation.  

Goal: Reliable, factual data ready for visualization.

1:00 PM - 2:00 PM: Lunch Break (1 hour)  
Rest to maintain productivity.

2:00 PM - 6:00 PM: Basic Visualization Implementation (4 hours)  
Build a graph where wallets are nodes and transactions are edges.  

Use an open-source library (with attribution for originality).  

Focus on clarity and readability for user experience.  

Goal: A functional, intuitive visualization.

6:00 PM - 8:00 PM: Add User Interactions (2 hours)  
Implement basic features like searching for a wallet or filtering transactions by amount.  

Ensure ease-of-use for both casual and expert users.  

Goal: A usable interface that supports investigation utility.

Day 2
8:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Enhance Visualization Features (4 hours)  
Add innovative elements (e.g., node size based on wallet balance, edge thickness based on transaction value).  

Optimize performance for technical execution.  

Test with sample data to ensure accuracy and impact.  

Goal: A polished, impactful visualization.

12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break (1 hour)  
Recharge for the final push.

1:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Testing and Debugging (2 hours)  
Test functionality, fix bugs, and verify data accuracy.  

Ensure the tool supports deep-dive analysis (investigation utility).  

Goal: A robust, error-free submission.

3:00 PM - 6:00 PM: Documentation and Write-Up (3 hours)  
Write a 1,000+ word overview in English, covering:  
Purpose and innovation of the tool.  

Technical details and data sources (with references).  

User guide for clarity and engagement.

Include links to all resources (e.g., Solana API docs, libraries used).  

Goal: A high-quality, readable submission that meets presentation criteria.

6:00 PM - 8:00 PM: Final Review and Submission Prep (2 hours)  
Review the tool and write-up against all judging criteria.  

Ensure the submission link is publicly viewable.  

Prepare a tweet tagging @DedMonkes
 with the submission link.  

Goal: A complete, compliant submission.

Key Considerations
Originality: We’ll build on open-source tools but add unique features (e.g., transaction-based edge thickness), with proper attribution.  

Accuracy: Data will be sourced from Solana’s official API or verified datasets.  

Resources: All references (e.g., API docs, libraries) will be cited in the write-up.  

Innovation & Impact: The graph will simplify complex blockchain data intuitively.  

Technical Execution: Code will be optimized and well-documented.  

User Experience: Simple controls will cater to all users.  

Investigation Utility: Filters and search will enable wallet/transaction analysis.

Risk Mitigation
Limited Time: Prioritize the MVP; enhancements are secondary.  

API Issues: Use mock data if Solana API access is delayed.  

Teamwork: If applicable, split tasks (e.g., one person on data, another on visualization).  

Documentation: Draft sections early to avoid a rush on Day 2.
